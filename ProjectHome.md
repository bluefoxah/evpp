The libevent library provides C/C++ developers with a flexible, high-performance framework for developing network applications.  With flexibility comes responsibility, however, and some common tasks are somewhat tedious.  This class library hopes to provide a small set of easy-to-use wrappers for performing common tasks (such as parsing URI query parameters.)  This library is under active development using the current libevent beta, 2.0.
